//!  Target refers to the computer that will be used to run an executable. It is composed
//! of the CPU architecture, the set of enabled CPU features, operating system, minimum
//! and maximum operating system version, ABI, and ABI version.
//!  Zig is a general-purpose programming language which means that it is designed to generate
//! optimal code for a large set of targets. The command zig targets provides information
//! about all of the targets the compiler is aware of.
//!  When no target option is provided to the compiler, the default choice is to target the host
//! computer, meaning that the resulting executable will be unsuitable for copying to a different
//! computer. In order to copy an executable to another computer, the compiler needs to know
//! about the target requirements via the -target option.
//!  The Zig Standard Library (@import("std")) has cross-platform abstractions, making the same
//! source code viable on many targets. Some code is more portable than other code. In general,
//! Zig code is extremely portable compared to other programming languages.
//!  Each platform requires its own implementations to make Zig's cross-platform abstractions work.
//! These implementations are at various degrees of completion. Each tagged release of the compiler
//! comes with release notes that provide the full support table for each target.
